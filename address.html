    </address> <!--The <address> tag is quite an obscure little tag, but that doesn't mean it isn't useful! As the name implies, <address> allows you to semantically mark up addresses in HTML. The nifty little tag will also italicize all of the data within the brackets, though the style can easily be changed through simple CSS.-->
